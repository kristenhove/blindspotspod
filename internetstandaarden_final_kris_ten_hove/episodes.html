            <h3>Episode 1: From ballots
                to bytes: Is democracy an
                illusion?</h3>
            <p>Examples where elections were directly affected by technology, where election days were discussed, and
                where votes were manipulated: Turkey, suspicions around the 2016 US elections.
                Security and freedom are closely connected. The security of elections ensures free will and the freedom
                to choose.
                At this point, we often think of the propaganda processes influenced by the production of fake content.
                Examples include...
                The problems of security and trust in politics can discourage political participation. Have we reached
                the end of democracy, a system that humans, as social beings, have created since the hunter-gatherer
                era? Will democracy become nothing more than an illusion in the face of all this technology? Or are you
                one of the few who refuses to stand by and let the world slip away? Then let's continue to challenge our
                minds: From banners to tweets.</p>

            <h3>Episode 2: From posters
                to algorithms: Why is
                voting so hard?</h3>
            <p> "I don't like politics at all."
                Global powers may not be able to make voters ineffective, but voters choose ineffectiveness. How do we
                make that choice, and why do we make it?
                Before reflecting on ourselves, let's first look at the global powers. While they can't render us
                powerless, they can manipulate us. How?
                Echo chambers. Algorithms. How does it work?
                How do algorithms shape our decisions?</p>

            <h3>Episode 3: From polders
                to filter bubbles: How does
                this affect my life?</h3>
            <p> Suicide, anger, manipulation, polarisation and echo chamber. What does politic mean? If politic is
                everywhere, can i take really distance? What difference does it make if I hear Kamala Harris, Wilders,
                Trump and Timmermans? Why is this important?</p>

            <h3>Episode 4: From banners
                to tweets: Why does my
                vote matter?
            </h3>
            <p>Voters choose ineffectiveness. Tackling the concerns of trust and security: A scientific approach to
                politics.
                To address a political issue, starting with two key factors: Our personal ethical values, which shape
                the questions we ask, and statistics.
                Can data be manipulated? Yes. Does altering data always leave a trace? Yes. In this case, can we reveal
                that the data has been tampered with? Yes.
                The key elements that will lead us to the most accurate statistics at the moment of decision: The
                comparative method, identifiable sources.
                The differences internet access and what does it mean for democracy</p>

            <h3>Episode 5: From election
                to everyday life: Will you accept the cookies?
            </h3>
            <p>Accessible internet and democracy? Does everyone need VPN? How private are private servers really? How
                privacy is circumvented to influence your opinions?
                What are cookies and why should or shouldn't you accept them? What kinds of information do different
                websites gather and how do they use this?
                Is it possible to be more private, and if so how would this affect your social media timeline,
                information gathering and eventually your views?</p>
